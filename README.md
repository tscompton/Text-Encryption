# Text-Encryption
text encrypt and decrypt program

This is a simple python program that will either encrypt or decrypt text in the encryption method chosen by the user.
To encrypt text choose encryption, type a message and EncodedMessage.txt will be created in the same location as the py file.
To decrypt text choose decryption. As of right now i have yet to add a way for the user to type the text in the console so the 
encrypted message must be in a text file located in the same folder as the py file. The full text file name must be used, 
ie "EncodedMessage.txt". The program will then create DecodedMessage.txt which will contain the decoded message.

As of now functionality is limited and only 3 encryption methods are available.
